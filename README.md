# Welcome to Jeebs

## History

I am definitely a backend developer at heart, although like everyone I have to write front-facing things sometimes! However I am happiest when I'm writing code that makes frontend development easier - and more beautiful.

The code in these libraries has been under active development and use for over a decade, powering all my own websites, and some for other people as well.

Jeebs v5 (and then v6) came from a) rewriting the entire codebase to make use of improvements in .NET 5.0, and C# 8 & 9, not least to null handling, and b) a COVID lockdown project of learning to write in F#. I thought for a while I might completely switch, but I decided I would prefer to bring some of the things I loved about F# into my C#.

Now with the imminent release of .NET 6, Jeebs v7 is born, pushing the gains of v5 further, and taking advantage of the new features and optimisations of .NET 6.

## Code Snippets

Many of the code snippets are designed to work in the excellent [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net).  You will need to install the relevant Jeebs NuGet packages and then import the Jeebs namespaces into your query (press F4 and go from there).​
